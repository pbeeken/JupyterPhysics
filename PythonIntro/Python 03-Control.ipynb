First we start with the keyword **for** followed by the mechanism for controlling the loop. The expression that follows starts with a variable that will hold the iterable element (**x** in this case) the key word **in** and a function which returns an 'iterable'. On the simplest level you can think of this as an array of numbers from 0 to one less than the argument (in this case 0,1,2,3...9). The expression ends with a colon which signals the computer that what follows is a set of instructions to contain within the loop using the variable **x**.  Notice that the lines that are to be contained in the loop are all indented with a single tab.  This last point is very important in python. *We saw this same syntax with function definitions.*\n","\n","That was a lot. Just try it and play with modifying some of the parts to see what happens.

We see the same indent construction to isolate the instructions to use inside the loop.  What we had to do differently was to explicityly initialize the x value to 0 and increment it manually at the end of the instructions.  The **while** loop, though, is a construct you can use when you are not sure when to end. For example you might want to read values from a user (remember the *input()* function?) until the user enters 0. You don't know when this might happen. Later when we read from files you might not know ahead of time how many lines the file has and you need to keep looping until you get to the end.\n","\n","The secret is in the test at the beginning. Here we tested against the value of x: ```x < 0```. As long as the loop, when it returned to this point, met this condition the sequence would continue. When this condition was no longer met when the execution returned to this point then it leaves the indented portion and starts running the first line that is not indented to the same level.
