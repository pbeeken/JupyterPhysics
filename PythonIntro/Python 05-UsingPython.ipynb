We want to explore this new skill to perform some basic mathematical modelling in physics. In order to proceed, we need to make sure we can use the basic constructs associated with the python programming language.\n","\n","**Python** is a programming language that is very forgiving to learn. It allows us to use it much the same way you would a calculator and provides the sophistication to advance your problems to complex models without much overhead in learning new coding tricks.  After we have mastered some basic operations we will then perform some more sophisticated operations by importing *libraries* which will simplify some of our more complex tasks.\n","\n","Note that this quickstart is not intended to replace a course such as [Learn python](https://www.learnpython.org/) which will give you a more complete understanding of the language.

When including a package you must preceed the function with the library name (or an alias, *see Python04-Packages*) as shown. To take the tangent of an angle we must write **np.tan(angle)** not **tan(angle)**. REMEMBER, by default, all angles are assumed to be in radians on input and if they produce angles on output then the measure is also in radians (like an inverse trig function). We have some convenience functions to make these converstions easy **np.radians** and **np.degrees**. You are resposible for keeping track what the results are.  We also see the **np.hypot** function and **np.atan2** function. If you know your trig and pythagorean relationships you should be able to figure out what these functions do.
