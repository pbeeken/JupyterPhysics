# JupyterPhysics
Coursework collections for teaching **Jupyter** as a tool in the classroom.
This is very much a work in progress and is being designed and redesigned as new 
features make there way into CoLab.  Much of this material will, hopefully, be presented 
at the 2021 AAPT winter conference for "Jupyter Notebooks in the High School Classroom"
