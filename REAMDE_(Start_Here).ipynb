When you took classes in quantitative science you used this same tool to compare values from experiments or observations with models that are meant to predict outcomes.  Now you are entering a phase when you must start creating these models directly.  Historically this has meant using a variety of tools that produce a final product that is a liberal mix of mathemaitcial constructs, tables of numbers, graphs of relationships and prose to tell as story of about how a piece of how our universe works in some small measure.  There isn't really a 'perfect' single tool for doing this.\n",

Tools like [MatLab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MATLAB), [Mathemaitca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfram_Mathematica), [MathCAD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathcad), and others came into existance that defined the general format of this idea.

        "Spreadsheets (*SS*) were a revolution in their day but are designed around and engineered for accounting.  Science coopted the technology because, much of the time, we catalog information in tables. The numerical capabilities of *SS* are ideal for performing systematic calculations on data by an element by element basis.  Data charting is also a standard feature of most spreadsheet environments and serves well to visualize large data sets.  The business application of spreadsheets, however, drives the design of these tools that require people in the engineering and science world to constantly adapt to this environment. As a consequence, using *SS* can become tedious.\n",

Spreadsheets organize data in cells.  To perform a calculation on a column of values requires that you set up the calculation for one cell and then copy the calculation down an entire adjacent column. Generally, this works well but if you desire to change the calculation (or model)  this sequence must be repeated each time.  For large datasets that extend below the view it is easy to make an error in the 'propogation' (copied down the column) and the imperfection can go unnoticed.  This was and still is a problem for financial modelers that serious consideration was given to the requirement that economic models submitted to banking regulators be done in a programming language which could be more easily evaluated and debugged.\n",
        "\n",
        "When it comes to graphing data, in an effort to make the manipulation of *SS* easy for all users, many of the operations requried to perform even routine tasks are done through menus and dialog boxes. If you don't keep careful track of which menu/dialog/option you chose and in what order, it is hard to reproduce what you did the next time you want to perform a similar set of operations. This problem becomes particularly acute with the graphing of data. Something we do all the time.\n",

        "\n",
        "Almost all business graphing assumes that data is equally spaced (daily, monthly or quarterly) so the need for charting correlated data pairs is rarely needed.  In engineering and science however, data comes as correlated pairs so we rely on '*scatter plots*'.  The default charting method in spreadsheets  often has to be overriden using a variety of menu and dialog steps which are hard to recall (Google sheets used to be an exception but they, too, have gone to the dark side &#x1F60E; for compatability reasons).\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, while *SS* are a fine tool, if you need to annotate or explain the nature of what you are doing or why, you must copy the relevant pieces to a word processing file (requiring a context switch) to document your activities.  Redoing a calculation or graph often requires navigating back and forth between a couple of related tools making revisions tedious.\n"

Unlike spreadsheets, the user can create and/or store datasets in named lists and perform calculations on a large sets of values as easily as if they were performing a calculation on a single value.  The graphing environment is rich and powerful (something we all aspire to) yet very easy to use.  The neat thing about the *Jupyter* world is that the user need not know programming to use the basic capabilities.  Yes, there is no simple menu system but this is an advantage as you have a complete record of the steps needed to produce a result like a calculation or plot.  You could, at first, just '*cookbook*' your way to the results.  With time and practice you become familiar with the most common elements and they will become second nature.\n",

Just as programming knowledge is not needed to use *SS* you don't have to be a programmer to use *Jupyter*.

The good news is mastering the basics of *jupyter* sets the user up fo learning the a programming language as the rules are absolutely consistent.  In *SS*, by contrast, local calculations bear no resemblance to the underlying scripting language (either visual basic or javascript) but in Jupyter the programming framework is the same throughout."

The *virtual machine* is started the moment you try to 'run' a code cell and remains active for as long as you are working with it. If you stop using it for a while, the machine shuts down and everything is wiped.  **Don't panic**.  Your notebook and anything you typed in it is preserved and saved automatically.
