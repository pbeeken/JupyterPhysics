        "<img src=\"https://jupyter.org/jupyter-book/images/logo/logo.png\" align=\"left\" width=\"50\"/>\n",
        "Jupyter is an interactive notebook where you can mix calculations, explanitory text and graphs in one document.  Originally developed for using python as an interactive tool for data science (the study and analysis of large data collections) it has grown to include a variety of different fields where spreadsheets don't quite capture the much needed combination of modelling and numerical analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Spreadsheets \n",
        "<img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/7d/Google_Sheets_Logo.jpg/52px-Google_Sheets_Logo.jpg\" align=\"left\" width=\"50\"/>\n",
        "Spreadsheets (*SS*) were a revolution in their day and are designed around and engineered for accounting.  Science has coopted the technology because, much of the time, we need to catalog information in tables and the numerical capabilities of *SS* are ideal for performing systematic calculations on the data on an element by element basis.  Later, graphing of data was added and is now a standard feature of most spreadsheet environments.  The business application of spreadsheets, however, drives the design of these tools that require people in the engineering and science world to constantly adapt what they need such that using *SS* can become tedious.\n",
        "\n",
        "<img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1L2MBuyqZ1l-kycsBj9APVUGYf8gOE0A1\" align=\"right\" width=\"400\"/> A clear example of how the mechanics of *SS* can get in the way of mathematical modelling is built in to the nature of how calculations are performed on large data sets.  Spreadsheets organize data in cells.  To perform a calculation on a column of values requires that you set up the calculation for one cell and then copy the cacluation down an entire adjacent column. Everything is fine but if you desire to change the calculation (or model)  this sequence must be repeated.  For large datasets that extend below view it is possible that the calculations might not be 'propogated' (copied down the column) correctly and the imperfection can go unnoticed.  This was such a problem for bank models that the FTC now requires that stress models submitted by banks be done in a programming language (as of this writing the recommended language is python).  \n",
        "\n",
        "Another example is graphing of data.  Almost all business graphing assumes that data is equally spaced (daily, monthly or quarterly) so the need for charting correlated data pairs is rarely needed.  In engineering and science, in general, data almost always comes as correlated pairs so we rely on 'scatter plots' .  <img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1L08ryhqPmbIdm-veBT3a6sQpKa3wq81B\" align=\"left\" width=\"200\"/> The default charting method in spreadsheets (Google sheets used to be an exception but they, too, have gone to the dark side &#x1F60E;).  \n",
        "\n",
        "Charting or grapjhing values are essential to visualizing numerical data sets. Especially as the sets get larger and models become more complex it is easier nay even vital that you visualize how the input (independent variable) influences the response of a system (dependent variable) graphically. \\[The graph at the left illustrates the default chart which sometimes guesses correctly whether you want a scatter or line plot, properly annotating the graph requires the user to go through a number of menu steps which can't be reproduced in a simple fashion]\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, while *SS* are a fine tool, if you need to annotate or explain the nature of what you are doing or why you must copy the relevant pieces to a word processing file (requiring a context switch) to document your activities.  Redoing a calculation or graph often requires navigating back and forth between a couple of related tools making revisions tedious.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Jupyter\n",
        "<img src=\"https://jupyter.org/assets/main-logo.svg\" align=\"right\"/>*Jupyter*, as already mentioned, is a uniform environment where data, graphics and text can be freely mixed with a powerful calculation capability to both model and analyze data. Unlike spreadsheets the user can create or store datasets in named lists and perform calculations on a large list of values as easily as if they were performing a calculation on a single value.  The graphing environment is rich and powerful (something we all aspire to) yet very easy to use.  The neat thing about the *jupyter* world is that the user need not know python programming to use the basic capabilities.  A general knowledge of algebra is sufficient.  Much in the same way programming knowledge is not needed for spreadsheets but is definitely a big help once you move past the basics, the *jupyter* environment definitely benefits those the pick up programming skills.  \n",
        "\n",
        "The good news is mastering the basics of *jupyter* sets the user up fo learning the python language as the rules are absolutely consistent.  In spreadsheets the local calculations bear no resemblance to the underlying scripting language (either visual basic or javascript) but in Jupyter the programming framework is the same throughout."

        "A long time ago, In a galaxy far, far away there were no WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) word processors. The world was filled with basic text editors and some specialized character combinations called *'mark up'* codes. These files that contained the text with embedded combination of characters that would signal to a program that would look for these codes and build a page with the appearance we wanted. The result would be then sent to a printer for final rendering.  Along came word processors and nifty ways to format documents 100 which ways.  All of these efforts meant navigating through deeply nested menus which took your attention away from your writing while you went on an adventure to find just the right font or decoration for your needs.  *'Mark down'* is a return to those bygone days where the mission isn't to pick the perfect font but to quickly and concisely communicate without distracting you from the task at hand. Deliberately, *mark down* is intended to be short and sweet with only a handful of commands.  Dispite its simplicity, however, you'll be astonished by its power.\n"

This is especially true if the data is generated from a data tool like Vernier, PASCO, OSP Tracker, or SysComp oscilloscopes.  There are many ways to pull data from these files but they all have some common elements.

        "   - You will get a message that the files will be deleted when you shut down your notebook. This is fine since you will still have the files in your Drive folder.\n",
        " 1. Direct upload from any laptop:\n",
        "   - This involves just one more step.\n",
        "   - Use your browser to navigate to the data file and download it to your local drive.\n",
        "   - You can now follow the directions for a chromebook \n",
        "   - When you UPLOAD, navigate to the same location where you saved the file.\n",

        "You can connect to google drive directly through a small number of fixed steps. The code that follows can be summarized as \n",

        " 0. Initiating the permissions\n",

        "This method is more reliable than the one-off method described above and allows for bi-directional reading and writing of data. The other advantage is that because you now have 'permission' to access your entire drive, you don't need to set permissions on individual files.\n",
        "\n",
        "Like the the pulling from **FileID** method above files are identified by their **FileID** which is not immediately visible. You still need to go into the permissions link to get this ID so you can pull the data using the read function. For this reason it is a good idea to collect all your data files into one easily located folder which will allow you to get the file based on its name.\n",
        "\n",
        "Suggestions to make life easier:\n",
        "  - Create a folder in your Colab Notebook folder which was created automatically when you started using this tool\n",
        "  - Name it something easy like 'data' or something (see the function below to see where you can change this name if you insist)\n",

This is much like our laptops with the guest accounts which delete everything when you log out.  The virtual environment you are working in is like having your own personal computer as long as you stay with it.  If you leave it alone too long. The machine shuts down and you loose the files.  Your notebook __is__ preserved, however, so you don't loose the code, graphs, and text you created."
